# Interpolation-Search-Analysis #Coursework

Synopsis:
- A project researching/analyzing the Interpolation Search algorithm and constructing a presentation on findings

Description:
- I worked with a partner to choose an algorithm and conduct research on the chosen algorighm in relation to its time complexity, both theoretically and empirically
- Coded the interpolation search algorithm (Java) using mathematical interpolation as a "jumping-off-point"
- Wrote Java code in order to run the interpolation search algorithm alongside binary search to see the different runtimes with different data and distribution of data
- Created a presentation that accurately describes the research process and results and analyzes the Big(O) runtime complexity of the algorithm based on theory and empirical data

Feel free to check out the Binary Search Java code, Interpolation Search Java code, and Tester Java code; along with the PowerPoint presentation.

**Tip: You will need to download the PowerPoint file and have PowerPoint (or an equivalent) installed in order to view.**
